python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by guido van rossum and first released in 1991. it is designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as c++ or java.\n\npython supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. in simpler terms, this means its flexible and allows you to write code in different ways, whether that's like giving the computer a to-do list (procedural), creating digital models of things or concepts (object-oriented), or treating your code like a math problem (functional).
